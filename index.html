                    <h3>WHY SOUTH AUSTRALIA?</h3>
                    <h2>From the outback to the coast and everywhere in between</h2>
                    <p>
                        Although most South Australianâ€™s live in the state capital city of Adelaide, the outer region of the state is where the hidden gems are.
                        Iconic Australian wildlife is minutes away from the Adelaide CBD, or a few hours away on the Eyre Peninsula is where you can swim with sea lions and sharks. 
                        Adelaide also has a mix of culinary deliciousness in fine-dining restaurants, award-winning cafes, food markets and boutique bars. 
                        South Australia is home to 18 wine regions and has been named a Great Wine Capital of the World. 
                        From the stunning coastlines to the sweeping plains of the outback, there is something for everyone to explore.
